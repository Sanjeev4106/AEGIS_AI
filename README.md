🛡️ AEGIS AI
Battlefield Acoustic Intelligence System

Listen. Analyze. Evaluate. Act.

AEGIS AI is a modular real-time acoustic intelligence system designed for battlefield and high-security environments. It detects, classifies, and evaluates environmental sounds, speech, and potential threats using a multi-layered AI pipeline.

Unlike traditional audio classifiers, AEGIS AI focuses on contextual danger evaluation, not just sound labeling.

🚀 Key Features
🎧 Sound Event Detection

Detects gunshots, explosions, alarms, footsteps, vehicles, etc.

Works in both file analysis and real-time mode.

🗣 Speech Recognition

Extracts speech from noisy environments.

Transcribes spoken content.

😡 Aggression Detection

Detects hostile tone patterns.

Identifies raised voices and stress signals.

🙂 Emotion Detection

Classifies emotional states (anger, fear, neutral, etc.)

Useful for threat anticipation.

⚠️ Threat Scoring Engine

Combines outputs from all modules.

Generates a dynamic Threat Index Score.

Designed to reduce false alarms from replay attacks or looped sounds.

🔍 Dual Operating Modes

File Analysis Mode – forensic audio report generation.

Real-Time Surveillance Mode – live microphone monitoring.

🎯 Vision

Traditional AI systems classify audio.
AEGIS AI aims to understand behavioral patterns and context.

It does not just ask:
“What is this sound?”

It asks:
“Is this sound behaving like a real threat?
